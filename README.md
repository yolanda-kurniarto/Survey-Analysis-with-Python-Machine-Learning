Project Title: Analyzing Survey Data to Investigate Sydney Swans' Fans Love and its Impact on Club Business Performance

Objective:
The main objective of this machine learning project is to analyze survey data collected from Sydney Swans' fans and investigate fans behaviour related to their love for the team. Additionally, the project aims to determine the impact of fans' love on the club's business performance. Based on the project objective, our team narrowed down the project scope to provide recommendations for the club. As such, the analysis seeks to answer three main questions:
1. How does Sydney Swans on-field performance impact game attendance?
2. What influences Sydney Swans' fans to become loyal supporters?
3. How can sydney Swans improve their season pass renewal intention?

Data Collection:
The survey data was provided by the University of Sydney and were not published due to confidentiality.

Data Preprocessing:
The data was preprocessed by following data cleaning procedures which includes evaluating infinity values, missing values, etc. Additionally, the variables of interest undergo feature engineering methods to convert into a structured format for the machine learning algorithms 

Data Analysis:
A subset of the survey data provided was used to investigate the key factors that contribute to fans' love for the team and their behaviour related to game events and the club. Three target variables from the survey were chosen based on the project objectives which include:
  - Game attendance 
  - Fans loyalty 
  - Season pass renew intention
  
The data was analysed using various machine learning algorithms, including logit model, random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector machines (SVM). The top performing model is used as the basis of analysis that will determine the impact of fans' love on the club's business performance.

Results and Recommendation:
1) Q1 - The gradient boost model, which outperforms the other three models, shows that on-field performmance impact match day attendance. The result shows that when the Sydney Swans team play calm and collected, as well as shows attention to their fans, would impact game day attendance. As such, it was recommended that the team interact and entertain with the crowd during games. 
2) Q2 - The SVM model, that is the top performer suggests that the three most important aspects that influence loyalty is a sense of belonging. In light of this, it is important that the club promotes community engagement by holding social gathering events or access to private lounge with exclusive membership. 
3) Q3 - The random forest model shows that fans motivation behind renewing their season pass is due to strong loyalty and love where fans have indicated that supporting the team is an important part of their lifes. To leverage this, it is advised that the team continually incentivize the fans to become loyal supoprters by offering exclusive limited tickets to Sydney Swans games.
